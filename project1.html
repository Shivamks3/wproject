     <h2> 1.Diet </h2>

    <p><font size ="3"><strong> Breakfast:</strong> A protein rich breakfast is a must. 
        An experiment by the University of Missouri involving 20 overweight females between the ages of 18 and 20 proved that a high protein breakfast led to reduced cravings and they also snacked less on unhealthy foods.

       <strong>Mid-morning snack: </strong> Fruits with buttermilk or green tea. “Green tea increases fat burning and improves physical performance.
       It can lower your risk of Type 2 diabetes, risk of cardiovascular disease and help you lose weight and lessen your risk of obesity,”
       <br> <br>
       <strong> Lunch: </strong> Homemade dal or legumes, roti, veggies with soup and green salad and raita or curd.
        <br> <br>
      <strong> Early-evening snack: </strong> Protein shake, nuts and seeds, veg sandwich or milk and apple. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University conducted a study which proved that nuts such as almonds have anti-cholesterol benefits and hence should be included in your diet.
        <br> <br>
       <strong>Dinner: </strong> Dal, veggies, with brown rice or roti and vegetable soup. And you should keep in mind that a light dinner is important, since the digestive system should get rest at night.

        There is no point depriving yourself of food. The mantra is to ‘Eat in moderation’.

    <h2> 2. Exercise </h2>

    <p> Exercising regularly, every day if possible, is the single most important thing you can do for your health. In the short term, exercise helps to control appetite, boost mood, and improve sleep. In the long term, it reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, dementia, depression, and many cancers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the following:
<br>
         <br>  <strong> For adults of all ages </strong><br>
            At least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise like brisk walking or 75 minutes of rigorous exercise like running (or an equivalent mix of both) every week.  It’s fine to break up exercise into smaller sessions as long as each one lasts at least 10 minutes.
            Strength-training that works all major muscle groups—legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms—at least two days a week.  Strength training may involve lifting weights, using resistance bands, or exercises like push-ups and sit-ups, in which your body weight furnishes the resistance.
          <br>  <br> <strong>For pregnant women </strong><br>
            The guidelines for aerobic exercise are considered safe for most pregnant women. The CDC makes no recommendation for strength training. It’s a good idea to review your exercise plan with your doctor.
            <br> <br>
        <strong>For children </strong><br>
            At least 60 minutes of physical activity a day, most of which should be devoted to aerobic exercise. Children should do vigorous exercise and strength training, such as push-ups or gymnastics, on at least three days every week.
